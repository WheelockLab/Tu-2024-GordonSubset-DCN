abstract = {The human cerebral cortex contains groups of areas that support sensory, motor, cognitive, and affective functions, often categorized into functional networks. These networks show stronger internal and weaker external functional connectivity (FC), with FC profiles more similar within the same network. Previous studies have shown these networks develop from nascent forms before birth to their mature, adult-like structures in childhood. However, these analyses often rely on adult functional network definitions. This study assesses the potential misidentification of infant functional networks when using adult models and explores the consequences and possible solutions to this problem. Our findings suggest that although adult networks only marginally describe infant FC organization better than chance, misidentification is primarily driven by specific areas. Restricting functional networks to areas with adult-like network clustering revealed consistent within-network FC across scans and throughout development. These areas are also near locations with low network identity variability. Our results highlight the implications of using adult networks for infants and offer guidance for selecting and utilizing functional network models based on research questions and scenarios.}
